## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.1.2 on Ubuntu 20.04
* win-builder (devel, release, old-release)
* R-hub standard platforms

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

Some Windows versions trigger a note about a URL, which is a false positive. 

## Downstream dependencies

I checked downstream dependencies with `revdepcheck::revdep_check` and all passed the test.
