## Resubmission

This is a re-re-submission from version 11.0.5 and from 11.0.5.1, now submitting with version 11.0.5.2. 
This should solve the issue, i.e. small discrepancies in test output due to numerical instabilities which are typically hard to detect on other platforms. 


## Test environments

* local R installation, R 4.4.1 on Ubuntu 20.04
* win-builder (devel, release, old-release)
